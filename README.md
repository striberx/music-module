# Music Module
Module for music operations for the Striber Discord bot

This module is not entirely meant for plug and play, although some processes of it could work that way. It was instead designed to be used as a reference.

Makes use of the fantastic [Moonlink.js](https://github.com/1Lucas1apk/moonlink.js) library to act as a Lavalink wrapper
Lavalink is **required**
